I'm running a blog now! This is served with Pages CMS at present; though I find the editing options a little underwhelming, so I'd like to look at alternatives some time soon.

I intend for this to be a pretty varied thing; I don't want this to be an anonymous wall of programming techniques. But for now, you have this post!
