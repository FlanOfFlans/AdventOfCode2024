I recently read the excellent blog post, [The Frontend Treadmill](https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/), by Marco Rogers. It's not new, but I'd missed it the first time around, and I think it rings true to my experiences.

I've been doing this for a lot less time than Rogers has, of course! But those of you who know me personally would know that I didn't aim for web development, initially--I was actually shooting for embedded engineering. And, yeah, maybe the industry where using C++ instead of C is considered indulgent isn't the best comparison, but it was quite a culture shock seeing just how _quickly_ web tech moves, and just how far off the metal it inevitably is.

What Rogers doesn't touch on so much is why, and I've wondered that myself. I think, part of it is a kind of industry-wide phase of 'spinning our wheels.' Bear with me a second:

The web is fundamentally a vehicle for other things we'd already like to do; shop, connect, learn. At one point going on the internet was fun in itself, maybe, but that novelty's worn off. Our mentors and predecessors built the future, but now the exciting future's the mundane present. We already have sites on which we shop, and connect, and learn. We can improve on them, and make new ones, but those huge sea-changes are a lot harder to find now. You can't build the next Facebook, because Facebook was already built. If you want to do something online, you can probably already do it, and do it pretty well.

But we want to build the future, too--I think that's why most of us got into this industry. It's what drew me to it, at least! So if we can't build the future, then I think it's easy to think we just need better tools. React will build the future; Vue will build the future; ChatGPT will build the future; Cursor will build the future.

And, hell, maybe one of them will. But I don't really think so. I think the web has already come, and already changed everything; I think the industry may simply have no more vast, world-shaking changes to give, and wherever the future comes from, will be from another domain.

So what? Everyone wants to change the world, but we can also make it a little better, a little at a time. That counts too.

(Though, I won't complain if we _do_ manage a clean break from JavaScript)
